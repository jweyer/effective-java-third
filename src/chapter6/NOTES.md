#Chapter 6. Enums and Annotations

JAVA supports two special-purpose families of reference types: a kind of class called an enum type, and a kind of 
interface called an annotation type. This chapter discusses best practices for using these type families.

## ITEM 34: USE ENUMS INSTEAD OF INT CONSTANTS

An enumerated type is a type whose legal values consist of a fixed set of constants, such as the seasons of the year, the 
planets in the solar system, or the suits in a deck of playing cards. Before enum types were added to the language, a 
common pattern for representing enumerated types was to declare a group of named int constants, one for each member of the type:

```aidl
// The int enum pattern - severely deficient!
public static final int APPLE_FUJI         = 0;
public static final int APPLE_PIPPIN       = 1;
public static final int APPLE_GRANNY_SMITH = 2;
public static final int ORANGE_NAVEL  = 0;
public static final int ORANGE_TEMPLE = 1;
public static final int ORANGE_BLOOD  = 2;
```

This technique, known as the int enum pattern, has many shortcomings. It provides nothing in the way of type safety and 
little in the way of expressive power. The compiler won’t complain if you pass an apple to a method that expects an orange, 
compare apples to oranges with the == operator, or worse:
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.}
```aidl
// Tasty citrus flavored applesauce!
int i = (APPLE_FUJI - ORANGE_TEMPLE) / APPLE_PIPPIN;
```

Note that the name of each apple constant is prefixed with APPLE_ and the name of each orange constant is prefixed with 
ORANGE_. This is because Java doesn’t provide namespaces for int enum groups. Prefixes prevent name clashes when two int 
enum groups have identically named constants, for example between ELEMENT_MERCURY and PLANET_MERCURY.

Programs that use int enums are brittle. Because int enums are constant variables [JLS, 4.12.4], their int values are 
compiled into the clients that use them [JLS, 13.1]. If the value associated with an int enum is changed, its clients 
must be recompiled. If not, the clients will still run, but their behavior will be incorrect.

There is no easy way to translate int enum constants into printable strings. If you print such a constant or display it 
from a debugger, all you see is a number, which isn’t very helpful. There is no reliable way to iterate over all the int 
enum constants in a group, or even to obtain the size of an int enum group.

You may encounter a variant of this pattern in which String constants are used in place of int constants. This variant, 
known as the String enum pattern, is even less desirable. While it does provide printable strings for its constants, it 
can lead naive users to hard-code string constants into client code instead of using field names. If such a hard-coded 
string constant contains a typographical error, it will escape detection at compile time and result in bugs at runtime. 
Also, it might lead to performance problems, because it relies on string comparisons.

Luckily, Java provides an alternative that avoids all the shortcomings of the int and string enum patterns and provides 
many added benefits. It is the enum type [JLS, 8.9]. Here’s how it looks in its simplest form:

```aidl
public enum Apple  { FUJI, PIPPIN, GRANNY_SMITH }

public enum Orange { NAVEL, TEMPLE, BLOOD }
```
On the surface, these enum types may appear similar to those of other languages, such as C, C++, and C#, but appearances 
are deceiving. Java’s enum types are full-fledged classes, far more powerful than their counterparts in these other 
languages, where enums are essentially int values.

The basic idea behind Java’s enum types is simple: they are classes that export one instance for each enumeration 
constant via a public static final field. Enum types are effectively final, by virtue of having no accessible constructors.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 
Because clients can neither create instances of an enum type nor extend it, there can be no instances but the declared 
enum constants. In other words, enum types are instance-controlled (page 6). They are a generalization of singletons (Item 3), 
which are essentially single-element enums.

Enums provide compile-time type safety. If you declare a parameter to be of type Apple, you are guaranteed that any 
non-null object reference passed to the parameter is one of the three valid Apple values. Attempts to pass values of the 
wrong type will result in compile-time errors, as will attempts to assign an expression of one enum type to a variable 
of another, or to use the == operator to compare values of different enum types.

Enum types with identically named constants coexist peacefully because each type has its own namespace. You can add or 
reorder constants in an enum type without recompiling its clients because the fields that export the constants provide a 
layer of insulation between an enum type and its clients: constant values are not compiled into the clients as they are 
in the int enum patterns. Finally, you can translate enums into printable strings by calling their toString method.

In addition to rectifying the deficiencies of int enums, enum types let you add arbitrary methods and fields and implement 
arbitrary interfaces. They provide high-quality implementations of all the Object methods (Chapter 3), they implement 
Comparable (Item 14) and Serializable (Chapter 12), and their serialized form is designed to withstand most changes to 
the enum type.

So why would you want to add methods or fields to an enum type? For starters, you might want to associate data with its 
constants. Our Apple and Orange types, for example, might benefit from a method that returns the color of the fruit, or 
one that returns an image of it. You can augment an enum type with any method that seems appropriate. An enum type can 
start life as a simple collection of enum constants and evolve over time into a full-featured abstraction.

For a nice example of a rich enum type, consider the eight planets of our solar system. Each planet has a mass and a 
radius, and from these two attributes you can compute its surface gravity. This in turn lets you compute the weight of 
an object on the planet’s surface, given the mass of the object. Here’s how this enum looks. The numbers in parentheses 
after each enum constant are parameters that are passed to its constructor. In this case, they are the planet’s mass and 
radius:

```aidl
// Enum type with data and behavior
public enum Planet {
    MERCURY(3.302e+23, 2.439e6),
    VENUS  (4.869e+24, 6.052e6),
    EARTH  (5.975e+24, 6.378e6),
    MARS   (6.419e+23, 3.393e6),
    JUPITER(1.899e+27, 7.149e7),
    SATURN (5.685e+26, 6.027e7),
    URANUS (8.683e+25, 2.556e7),
    NEPTUNE(1.024e+26, 2.477e7);

    private final double mass;           // In kilograms
    private final double radius;         // In meters
    private final double surfaceGravity; // In m / s^2

    // Universal gravitational constant in m^3 / kg s^2
    private static final double G = 6.67300E-11;

    // Constructor
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
        surfaceGravity = G * mass / (radius * radius);
    }

    public double mass()           { return mass; }
    public double radius()         { return radius; }
    public double surfaceGravity() { return surfaceGravity; }

    public double surfaceWeight(double mass) {
        return mass * surfaceGravity;  // F = ma
    }
}
```
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 

It is easy to write a rich enum type such as Planet. To associate data with enum constants, declare instance fields and 
write a constructor that takes the data and stores it in the fields. Enums are by their nature immutable, so all fields 
should be final (Item 17). Fields can be public, but it is better to make them private and provide public accessors (Item 16). 
In the case of Planet, the constructor also computes and stores the surface gravity, but this is just an optimization. 
The gravity could be recomputed from the mass and radius each time it was used by the surfaceWeight method, which takes 
an object’s mass and returns its weight on the planet represented by the constant.

While the Planet enum is simple, it is surprisingly powerful. Here is a short program that takes the earth weight of an 
object (in any unit) and prints a nice table of the object’s weight on all eight planets (in the same unit):

```aidl
public class WeightTable {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      double earthWeight = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
      double mass = earthWeight / Planet.EARTH.surfaceGravity();
      for (Planet p : Planet.values())
          System.out.printf("Weight on %s is %f%n",
                            p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));
      }
}
```
Note that Planet, like all enums, has a static values method that returns an array of its values in the order they were 
declared. Note also that the toString method returns the declared name of each enum value, enabling easy printing by p
rintln and printf. If you’re dissatisfied with this string representation, you can change it by overriding the toString 
method. Here is the result of running our WeightTable program (which doesn’t override toString) with the command line argument 185:

```aidl
Weight on MERCURY is 69.912739
Weight on VENUS is 167.434436
Weight on EARTH is 185.000000
Weight on MARS is 70.226739
Weight on JUPITER is 467.990696
Weight on SATURN is 197.120111
Weight on URANUS is 167.398264
Weight on NEPTUNE is 210.208751
```

Until 2006, two years after enums were added to Java, Pluto was a planet. This raises the question “what happens when 
you remove an element from an enum type?” The answer is that any client program that doesn’t refer to the removed element 
will continue to work fine. So, for example, our WeightTable program would simply print a table with one fewer row. And 
what of a client program that refers to the removed element (in this case, Planet.Pluto)? If you recompile the client 
program, the compilation will fail with a helpful error message at the line that refers to the erstwhile planet; if you 
fail to recompile the client, it will throw a helpful exception from this line at runtime. This is the best behavior you 
could hope for, far better than what you’d get with the int enum pattern.

Some behaviors associated with enum constants may need to be used only from within the class or package in which the enum 
is defined. Such behaviors are best implemented as private or package-private methods. Each constant then carries with 
it a hidden collection of behaviors that allows the class or package containing the enum to react appropriately when 
presented with the constant. Just as with other classes, unless you have a compelling reason to expose an enum method to 
its clients, declare it private or, if need be, package-private (Item 15).

If an enum is generally useful, it should be a top-level class; if its use is tied to a specific top-level class, it 
should be a member class of that top-level class (Item 24). For example, the java.math.RoundingMode enum represents a 
rounding mode for decimal fractions. These rounding modes are used by the BigDecimal class, but they provide a useful 
abstraction that is not fundamentally tied to BigDecimal. By making RoundingMode a top-level enum, the library designers
encourage any programmer who needs rounding modes to reuse this enum, leading to increased consistency across APIs.

The techniques demonstrated in the Planet example are sufficient for most enum types, but sometimes you need more. There 
is different data associated with each Planet constant, but sometimes you need to associate fundamentally different 
behavior with each constant. For example, suppose you are writing an enum type to represent the operations on a basic 
four-function calculator and you want to provide a method to perform the arithmetic operation represented by each 
constant. One way to achieve this is to switch on the value of the enum:

```aidl
// Enum type that switches on its own value - questionable
public enum Operation {
    PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, DIVIDE;

    // Do the arithmetic operation represented by this constant
    public double apply(double x, double y) {
        switch(this) {
            case PLUS:   return x + y;
            case MINUS:  return x - y;
            case TIMES:  return x * y;
            case DIVIDE: return x / y;
        }
        throw new AssertionError("Unknown op: " + this);
    }

}
```

This code works, but it isn’t very pretty. It won’t compile without the throw statement because the end of the method is
technically reachable, even though it will never be reached [JLS, 14.21]. Worse, the code is fragile. If you add a new 
enum constant but forget to add a corresponding case to the switch, the enum will still compile, but it will fail at 
runtime when you try to apply the new operation.

Luckily, there is a better way to associate a different behavior with each enum constant: declare an abstract apply 
method in the enum type, and override it with a concrete method for each constant in a constant-specific class body. 
Such methods are known as constant-specific method implementations:
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 
```aidl
// Enum type with constant-specific method implementations
public enum Operation {
  PLUS  {public double apply(double x, double y){return x + y;}},
  MINUS {public double apply(double x, double y){return x - y;}},
  TIMES {public double apply(double x, double y){return x * y;}},
  DIVIDE{public double apply(double x, double y){return x / y;}};

  public abstract double apply(double x, double y);
}
```
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 

If you add a new constant to the second version of Operation, it is unlikely that you’ll forget to provide an apply 
method, because the method immediately follows each constant declaration. In the unlikely event that you do forget, the 
compiler will remind you because abstract methods in an enum type must be overridden with concrete methods in all of 
its constants.

Constant-specific method implementations can be combined with constant-specific data. For example, here is a version of 
Operation that overrides the toString method to return the symbol commonly associated with the operation:

```aidl
// Enum type with constant-specific class bodies and data
public enum Operation {

    PLUS("+") {
        public double apply(double x, double y) { return x + y; }
    },

    MINUS("-") {
        public double apply(double x, double y) { return x - y; }
    },

    TIMES("*") {
        public double apply(double x, double y) { return x * y; }
    },

    DIVIDE("/") {
        public double apply(double x, double y) { return x / y; }
    };

    private final String symbol;

    Operation(String symbol) { this.symbol = symbol; }

    @Override public String toString() { return symbol; }

    public abstract double apply(double x, double y);
}
```

The toString implementation shown makes it easy to print arithmetic expressions, as demonstrated by this little program:

```aidl
public static void main(String[] args) {

    double x = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
    double y = Double.parseDouble(args[1]);

    for (Operation op : Operation.values())
        System.out.printf("%f %s %f = %f%n",
                          x, op, y, op.apply(x, y));
}
```

Running this program with 2 and 4 as command line arguments produces the following output:

```aidl
2.000000 + 4.000000 = 6.000000
2.000000 - 4.000000 = -2.000000
2.000000 * 4.000000 = 8.000000
2.000000 / 4.000000 = 0.500000
```

Enum types have an automatically generated valueOf(String) method that translates a constant’s name into the constant 
itself. If you override the toString method in an enum type, consider writing a fromString method to translate the custom 
string representation back to the corresponding enum. The following code (with the type name changed appropriately) will 
do the trick for any enum, so long as each constant has a unique string representation:

```aidl
// Implementing a fromString method on an enum type
private static final Map<String, Operation> stringToEnum =
        Stream.of(values()).collect(
            toMap(Object::toString, e -> e));
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 

// Returns Operation for string, if any
public static Optional<Operation> fromString(String symbol) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(stringToEnum.get(symbol));
}
```
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 
Note that the Operation constants are put into the stringToEnum map from a static field initialization that runs after 
the enum constants have been created. The previous code uses a stream (Chapter 7) over the array returned by the values() 
method; prior to Java 8, we would have created an empty hash map and iterated over the values array inserting the 
string-to-enum mappings into the map, and you can still do it that way if you prefer. But note that attempting to have 
each constant put itself into a map from its own constructor does not work. It would cause a compilation error, which is 
good thing because if it were legal, it would cause a NullPointerException at runtime. Enum constructors aren’t permitted 
to access the enum’s static fields, with the exception of constant variables (Item 34). This restriction is necessary 
because static fields have not yet been initialized when enum constructors run. A special case of this restriction is that 
enum constants cannot access one another from their constructors.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 

Also note that the fromString method returns an Optional<String>. This allows the method to indicate that the string that 
was passed in does not represent a valid operation, and it forces the client to confront this possibility (Item 55).

A disadvantage of constant-specific method implementations is that they make it harder to share code among enum constants.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 
For example, consider an enum representing the days of the week in a payroll package. This enum has a method that 
calculates a worker’s pay for that day given the worker’s base salary (per hour) and the number of minutes worked on that 
day. On the five weekdays, any time worked in excess of a normal shift generates overtime pay; on the two weekend days, 
all work generates overtime pay. With a switch statement, it’s easy to do this calculation by applying multiple case labels 
to each of two code fragments:

```aidl
// Enum that switches on its value to share code - questionable
enum PayrollDay {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY, SUNDAY;

    private static final int MINS_PER_SHIFT = 8 * 60;

    int pay(int minutesWorked, int payRate) {
        int basePay = minutesWorked * payRate;

        int overtimePay;
        switch(this) {
          case SATURDAY: case SUNDAY: // Weekend
            overtimePay = basePay / 2;
            break;
          default: // Weekday
            overtimePay = minutesWorked <= MINS_PER_SHIFT ?
              0 : (minutesWorked - MINS_PER_SHIFT) * payRate / 2;
        }

        return basePay + overtimePay;
    }
}
```

This code is undeniably concise, but it is dangerous from a maintenance perspective. Suppose you add an element to the 
enum, perhaps a special value to represent a vacation day, but forget to add a corresponding case to the switch statement. 
The program will still compile, but the pay method will silently pay the worker the same amount for a vacation day as for 
an ordinary weekday.

To perform the pay calculation safely with constant-specific method implementations, you would have to duplicate the 
overtime pay computation for each constant, or move the computation into two helper methods, one for weekdays and one for 
weekend days, and invoke the appropriate helper method from each constant. Either approach would result in a fair amount 
of boilerplate code, substantially reducing readability and increasing the opportunity for error.

The boilerplate could be reduced by replacing the abstract overtimePay method on PayrollDay with a concrete method that 
performs the overtime calculation for weekdays. Then only the weekend days would have to override the method. But this 
would have the same disadvantage as the switch statement: if you added another day without overriding the overtimePay 
method, you would silently inherit the weekday calculation.

What you really want is to be forced to choose an overtime pay strategy each time you add an enum constant. Luckily, 
there is a nice way to achieve this. The idea is to move the overtime pay computation into a private nested enum, and to 
pass an instance of this strategy enum to the constructor for the PayrollDay enum. The PayrollDay enum then delegates the 
overtime pay calculation to the strategy enum, eliminating the need for a switch statement or constant-specific method 
implementation in PayrollDay. While this pattern is less concise than the switch statement, it is safer and more flexible:

```aidl
// The strategy enum pattern
enum PayrollDay {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY(PayType.WEEKEND), SUNDAY(PayType.WEEKEND);

    private final PayType payType;

    PayrollDay(PayType payType) { this.payType = payType; }
    PayrollDay() { this(PayType.WEEKDAY); }  // Default
    
    int pay(int minutesWorked, int payRate) {
        return payType.pay(minutesWorked, payRate);
    }

    // The strategy enum type
    private enum PayType {
        WEEKDAY {
            int overtimePay(int minsWorked, int payRate) {
                return minsWorked <= MINS_PER_SHIFT ? 0 :
                  (minsWorked - MINS_PER_SHIFT) * payRate / 2;
            }
        },
        WEEKEND {
            int overtimePay(int minsWorked, int payRate) {
                return minsWorked * payRate / 2;
            }
        };

        abstract int overtimePay(int mins, int payRate);
        private static final int MINS_PER_SHIFT = 8 * 60;

        int pay(int minsWorked, int payRate) {
            int basePay = minsWorked * payRate;
            return basePay + overtimePay(minsWorked, payRate);
        }
    }
}
```

If switch statements on enums are not a good choice for implementing constant-specific behavior on enums, what are they 
good for? Switches on enums are good for augmenting enum types with constant-specific behavior. For example, suppose the 
Operation enum is not under your control and you wish it had an instance method to return the inverse of each operation. 
You could simulate the effect with the following static method:
```aidl
// Switch on an enum to simulate a missing method
public static Operation inverse(Operation op) {
    switch(op) {
        case PLUS:   return Operation.MINUS;
        case MINUS:  return Operation.PLUS;
        case TIMES:  return Operation.DIVIDE;
        case DIVIDE: return Operation.TIMES;

        default:  throw new AssertionError("Unknown op: " + op);
    }
}

```
You should also use this technique on enum types that are under your control if a method simply doesn’t belong in the 
enum type. The method may be required for some use but is not generally useful enough to merit inclusion in the enum type.

Enums are, generally speaking, comparable in performance to int constants. A minor performance disadvantage of enums is 
that there is a space and time cost to load and initialize enum types, but it is unlikely to be noticeable in practice.

So when should you use enums? Use enums any time you need a set of constants whose members are known at compile time. 
Of course, this includes “natural enumerated types,” such as the planets, the days of the week, and the chess pieces. 
But it also includes other sets for which you know all the possible values at compile time, such as choices on a menu, 
operation codes, and command line flags. It is not necessary that the set of constants in an enum type stay fixed for all 
time. The enum feature was specifically designed to allow for binary compatible evolution of enum types.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.} 

### In summary, the advantages of enum types over int constants are compelling. Enums are more readable, safer, and more powerful. Many enums require no explicit constructors or members, but others benefit from associating data with each constant and providing methods whose behavior is affected by this data. Fewer enums benefit from associating multiple behaviors with a single method. In this relatively rare case, prefer constant-specific methods to enums that switch on their own values. Consider the strategy enum pattern if some, but not all, enum constants share common behaviors.

## ITEM 35: USE INSTANCE FIELDS INSTEAD OF ORDINALS
Many enums are naturally associated with a single int value. All enums have an ordinal method, which returns the numerical 
position of each enum constant in its type. You may be tempted to derive an associated int value from the ordinal:

```aidl
// Abuse of ordinal to derive an associated value - DON'T DO THIS
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO,   DUET,   TRIO, QUARTET, QUINTET,
    SEXTET, SEPTET, OCTET, NONET,  DECTET;
    public int numberOfMusicians() { return ordinal() + 1; }
}
```

While this enum works, it is a maintenance nightmare. If the constants are reordered, the numberOfMusicians method will 
break. If you want to add a second enum constant associated with an int value that you’ve already used, you’re out of 
luck. For example, it might be nice to add a constant for double quartet, which, like an octet, consists of eight 
musicians, but there is no way to do it.

Also, you can’t add a constant for an int value without adding constants for all intervening int values. For example, 
suppose you want to add a constant representing a triple quartet, which consists of twelve musicians. There is no standard 
term for an ensemble consisting of eleven musicians, so you are forced to add a dummy constant for the unused 
int value (11). At best, this is ugly. If many int values are unused, it’s impractical.

Luckily, there is a simple solution to these problems. Never derive a value associated with an enum from its ordinal; 
store it in an instance field instead:

```aidl
public enum Ensemble {
    SOLO(1), DUET(2), TRIO(3), QUARTET(4), QUINTET(5),
    SEXTET(6), SEPTET(7), OCTET(8), DOUBLE_QUARTET(8),
    NONET(9), DECTET(10), TRIPLE_QUARTET(12);

    private final int numberOfMusicians;
    Ensemble(int size) { this.numberOfMusicians = size; }

    public int numberOfMusicians() { return numberOfMusicians; }
}
```

### The Enum specification has this to say about ordinal: “Most programmers will have no use for this method. It is designed for use by general-purpose enum-based data structures such as EnumSet and EnumMap.” Unless you are writing code with this character, you are best off avoiding the ordinal method entirely.

## ITEM 36: USE ENUMSET INSTEAD OF BIT FIELDS
If the elements of an enumerated type are used primarily in sets, it is traditional to use the int enum pattern (Item 34), 
assigning a different power of 2 to each constant:

```aidl
// Bit field enumeration constants - OBSOLETE!
public class Text {

    public static final int STYLE_BOLD          = 1 << 0;  // 1
    public static final int STYLE_ITALIC        = 1 << 1;  // 2
    public static final int STYLE_UNDERLINE     = 1 << 2;  // 4
    public static final int STYLE_STRIKETHROUGH = 1 << 3;  // 8

    // Parameter is bitwise OR of zero or more STYLE_ constants
    public void applyStyles(int styles) { ... }
}
```
This representation lets you use the bitwise OR operation to combine several constants into a set, known as a bit field:

```aidl
text.applyStyles(STYLE_BOLD | STYLE_ITALIC);
```
The bit field representation also lets you perform set operations such as union and intersection efficiently using 
bitwise arithmetic. But bit fields have all the disadvantages of int enum constants and more. It is even harder to 
interpret a bit field than a simple int enum constant when it is printed as a number. There is no easy way to iterate 
over all of the elements represented by a bit field. Finally, you have to predict the maximum number of bits you’ll ever 
need at the time you’re writing the API and choose a type for the bit field (typically int or long) accordingly. Once 
you’ve picked a type, you can’t exceed its width (32 or 64 bits) without changing the API.

Some programmers who use enums in preference to int constants still cling to the use of bit fields when they need to 
pass around sets of constants. There is no reason to do this, because a better alternative exists. The java.util package 
provides the EnumSet class to efficiently represent sets of values drawn from a single enum type. This class implements 
the Set interface, providing all of the richness, type safety, and interoperability you get with any other Set 
implementation. But internally, each EnumSet is represented as a bit vector. If the underlying enum type has sixty-four 
or fewer elements—and most do—the entire EnumSet is represented with a single long, so its performance is comparable to 
that of a bit field. Bulk operations, such as removeAll and retainAll, are implemented using bitwise arithmetic, just as 
you’d do manually for bit fields. But you are insulated from the ugliness and error-proneness of manual bit twiddling: 
the EnumSet does the hard work for you.

Here is how the previous example looks when modified to use enums and enum sets instead of bit fields. It is shorter, 
clearer, and safer:

```aidl
// EnumSet - a modern replacement for bit fields
public class Text {

    public enum Style { BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERLINE, STRIKETHROUGH }

    // Any Set could be passed in, but EnumSet is clearly best
    public void applyStyles(Set<Style> styles) { ... }
}
```
Here is client code that passes an EnumSet instance to the applyStyles method. The EnumSet class provides a rich set of 
static factories for easy set creation, one of which is illustrated in this code:

text.applyStyles(EnumSet.of(Style.BOLD, Style.ITALIC));

Note that the applyStyles method takes a Set<Style> rather than an EnumSet<Style>. While it seems likely that all clients
would pass an EnumSet to the method, it is generally good practice to accept the interface type rather than the implementation 
type (Item 64). This allows for the possibility of an unusual client to pass in some other Set implementation.

### In summary, just because an enumerated type will be used in sets, there is no reason to represent it with bit fields. The EnumSet class combines the conciseness and performance of bit fields with all the many advantages of enum types described in Item 34. The one real disadvantage of EnumSet is that it is not, as of Java 9, possible to create an immutable EnumSet, but this will likely be remedied in an upcoming release. In the meantime, you can wrap an EnumSet with Collections.unmodifiableSet, but conciseness and performance will suffer.

## ITEM 37: USE ENUMMAP INSTEAD OF ORDINAL INDEXING
Occasionally you may see code that uses the ordinal method (Item 35) to index into an array or list. For example, 
consider this simplistic class meant to represent a plant:

```aidl
class Plant {

    enum LifeCycle { ANNUAL, PERENNIAL, BIENNIAL }

    final String name;
    final LifeCycle lifeCycle;

    Plant(String name, LifeCycle lifeCycle) {
        this.name = name;
        this.lifeCycle = lifeCycle;
    }

    @Override public String toString() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

Now suppose you have an array of plants representing a garden, and you want to list these plants organized by life cycle 
(annual, perennial, or biennial). To do this, you construct three sets, one for each life cycle, and iterate through the 
garden, placing each plant in the appropriate set. Some programmers would do this by putting the sets into an array 
indexed by the life cycle’s ordinal:

```aidl
// Using ordinal() to index into an array - DON'T DO THIS!
Set<Plant>[] plantsByLifeCycle =
    (Set<Plant>[]) new Set[Plant.LifeCycle.values().length];
for (int i = 0; i < plantsByLifeCycle.length; i++)
    plantsByLifeCycle[i] = new HashSet<>();

for (Plant p : garden)
    plantsByLifeCycle[p.lifeCycle.ordinal()].add(p);

// Print the results
for (int i = 0; i < plantsByLifeCycle.length; i++) {
    System.out.printf("%s: %s%n",
        Plant.LifeCycle.values()[i], plantsByLifeCycle[i]);
}
```

This technique works, but it is fraught with problems. Because arrays are not compatible with generics (Item 28), the 
program requires an unchecked cast and will not compile cleanly. Because the array does not know what its index 
represents, you have to label the output manually. But the most serious problem with this technique is that when you 
access an array that is indexed by an enum’s ordinal, it is your responsibility to use the correct int value; ints do 
not provide the type safety of enums. If you use the wrong value, the program will silently do the wrong thing or—if 
you’re lucky—throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

There is a much better way to achieve the same effect. The array is effectively serving as a map from the enum to a 
value, so you might as well use a Map. More specifically, there is a very fast Map implementation designed for use with 
enum keys, known as java.util.EnumMap. Here is how the program looks when it is rewritten to use EnumMap:

```aidl
// Using an EnumMap to associate data with an enum
Map<Plant.LifeCycle, Set<Plant>>  plantsByLifeCycle =
    new EnumMap<>(Plant.LifeCycle.class);
for (Plant.LifeCycle lc : Plant.LifeCycle.values())
    plantsByLifeCycle.put(lc, new HashSet<>());
for (Plant p : garden)
    plantsByLifeCycle.get(p.lifeCycle).add(p);
System.out.println(plantsByLifeCycle);
```

This program is shorter, clearer, safer, and comparable in speed to the original version. There is no unsafe cast; no 
need to label the output manually because the map keys are enums that know how to translate themselves to printable 
strings; and no possibility for error in computing array indices. The reason that EnumMap is comparable in speed to an 
ordinal-indexed array is that EnumMap uses such an array internally, but it hides this implementation detail from the 
programmer, combining the richness and type safety of a Map with the speed of an array. Note that the EnumMap constructor 
takes the Class object of the key type: this is a bounded type token, which provides runtime generic type information 
(Item 33).

The previous program can be further shortened by using a stream (Item 45) to manage the map. Here is the simplest 
stream-based code that largely duplicates the behavior of the previous example:

```aidl
// Naive stream-based approach - unlikely to produce an EnumMap!
System.out.println(Arrays.stream(garden)
        .collect(groupingBy(p -> p.lifeCycle)));
```


The problem with this code is that it chooses its own map implementation, and in practice it won’t be an EnumMap, so it
won’t match the space and time performance of the version with the explicit EnumMap. To rectify this problem, use the 
three-parameter form of Collectors.groupingBy, which allows the caller to specify the map implementation using the 
mapFactory parameter:

```aidl
// Using a stream and an EnumMap to associate data with an enum
System.out.println(Arrays.stream(garden)
        .collect(groupingBy(p -> p.lifeCycle,
            () -> new EnumMap<>(LifeCycle.class), toSet())));
```

This optimization would not be worth doing in a toy program like this one but could be critical in a program that made 
heavy use of the map.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.}

The behavior of the stream-based versions differs slightly from that of the EmumMap version. The EnumMap version always 
makes a nested map for each plant lifecycle, while the stream-based versions only make a nested map if the garden 
contains one or more plants with that lifecycle. So, for example, if the garden contains annuals and perennials but no 
biennials, the size of plantsByLifeCycle will be three in the EnumMap version and two in both of the stream-based versions.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.}

You may see an array of arrays indexed (twice!) by ordinals used to represent a mapping from two enum values. For example, 
this program uses such an array to map two phases to a phase transition (liquid to solid is freezing, liquid to gas is 
boiling, and so forth):

```aidl
// Using ordinal() to index array of arrays - DON'T DO THIS!
public enum Phase {
    SOLID, LIQUID, GAS;

    public enum Transition {
        MELT, FREEZE, BOIL, CONDENSE, SUBLIME, DEPOSIT;

        // Rows indexed by from-ordinal, cols by to-ordinal

        private static final Transition[][] TRANSITIONS = {
            { null,    MELT,     SUBLIME },
            { FREEZE,  null,     BOIL    },
            { DEPOSIT, CONDENSE, null    }
        };

        // Returns the phase transition from one phase to another
        public static Transition from(Phase from, Phase to) {
            return TRANSITIONS[from.ordinal()][to.ordinal()];
        }
    }
}
```

This program works and may even appear elegant, but appearances can be deceiving. Like the simpler garden example shown 
earlier, the compiler has no way of knowing the relationship between ordinals and array indices. If you make a mistake 
in the transition table or forget to update it when you modify the Phase or Phase.Transition enum type, your program 
will fail at runtime. The failure may be an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, a NullPointerException, or (worse) silent 
erroneous behavior. And the size of the table is quadratic in the number of phases, even if the number of non-null 
entries is smaller.

Again, you can do much better with EnumMap. Because each phase transition is indexed by a pair of phase enums, you are 
best off representing the relationship as a map from one enum (the “from” phase) to a map from the second enum (the “to” 
phase) to the result (the phase transition). The two phases associated with a phase transition are best captured by 
associating them with the phase transition enum, which can then be used to initialize the nested EnumMap:

```aidl
// Using a nested EnumMap to associate data with enum pairs

public enum Phase {

   SOLID, LIQUID, GAS;
   public enum Transition {
      MELT(SOLID, LIQUID), FREEZE(LIQUID, SOLID),
      BOIL(LIQUID, GAS),   CONDENSE(GAS, LIQUID),
      SUBLIME(SOLID, GAS), DEPOSIT(GAS, SOLID);

      private final Phase from;
      private final Phase to;
      
      Transition(Phase from, Phase to) {
         this.from = from;
         this.to = to;
      }

      // Initialize the phase transition map
      private static final Map<Phase, Map<Phase, Transition>>
        m = Stream.of(values()).collect( groupingBy(t -> t.from,
            () -> new EnumMap<>(Phase.class),
            toMap(t -> t.to, t -> t,
            (x, y) -> y, () -> new EnumMap<>(Phase.class) ) ) 
        );
     {Aaron notes: Above is an important design.}       

      public static Transition from(Phase from, Phase to) {
         return m.get(from).get(to);
      }
   }
}
```

The code to initialize the phase transition map is a bit complicated. The type of the map is 
Map<Phase, Map<Phase, Transition>>, which means “map from (source) phase to map from (destination) phase to transition.”
This map-of-maps is initialized using a cascaded sequence of two collectors. The first collector groups the transitions 
by source phase, and the second creates an EnumMap with mappings from destination phase to transition. The merge function 
in the second collector ((x, y) -> y)) is unused; it is required only because we need to specify a map factory in order 
to get an EnumMap, and Collectors provides telescoping factories. The previous edition of this book used explicit 
iteration to initialize the phase transition map. The code was more verbose but arguably easier to understand.
{Aaron notes: Above is an important design.}

Now suppose you want to add a new phase to the system: plasma, or ionized gas. There are only two transitions associated 
with this phase: ionization, which takes a gas to a plasma; and deionization, which takes a plasma to a gas. To update 
the array-based program, you would have to add one new constant to Phase and two to Phase.Transition, and replace the 
original nine-element array of arrays with a new sixteen-element version. If you add too many or too few elements to the 
array or place an element out of order, you are out of luck: the program will compile, but it will fail at runtime. To 
update the EnumMap-based version, all you have to do is add PLASMA to the list of phases, and IONIZE(GAS, PLASMA) and 
DEIONIZE(PLASMA, GAS) to the list of phase transitions:

```aidl
// Adding a new phase using the nested EnumMap implementation
public enum Phase {
    SOLID, LIQUID, GAS, PLASMA;

    public enum Transition {
        MELT(SOLID, LIQUID), FREEZE(LIQUID, SOLID),
        BOIL(LIQUID, GAS),   CONDENSE(GAS, LIQUID),
        SUBLIME(SOLID, GAS), DEPOSIT(GAS, SOLID),
        IONIZE(GAS, PLASMA), DEIONIZE(PLASMA, GAS);
        ... // Remainder unchanged
    }
}
```

The program takes care of everything else and leaves you virtually no opportunity for error. Internally, the map of maps 
is implemented with an array of arrays, so you pay little in space or time cost for the added clarity, safety, and ease 
of maintenance.

In the interest of brevity, the above examples use null to indicate the absence of a state change (wherein to and from 
are identical). This is not good practice and is likely to result in a NullPointerException at runtime. Designing a 
clean, elegant solution to this problem is surprisingly tricky, and the resulting programs are sufficiently long that 
they would detract from the primary material in this item.

### In summary, it is rarely appropriate to use ordinals to index into arrays: use EnumMap instead. If the relationship you are representing is multidimensional, use EnumMap<..., EnumMap<...>>. This is a special case of the general principle that application programmers should rarely, if ever, use Enum.ordinal (Item 35).
