## FOUR KINDS OF TYPES IN JAVA
1. Interfaces (including Annotations)
2. Classes (including Enums)
3. Arrays
4. Primitives

The first three are known as reference types.
Class instances and arrays are objects; primitive values are not.
A class's members consist of fields, methods, member classes, and member interfaces.
A method's signature consists of its name and the type of its formal parameters.
The method signature does not include the method's return type.
